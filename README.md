Create an Employee Directory using Components State tha responds to User Events , e.g. Sort / Filter .

REACT / AXIOS

The application base was a REACT app that would display a list of employees from a user site where certain information would be listed for each person , e.g., name , date of birth , phone , etc and the user would be able to manipulate the information using sorting / filtering options based on name / phone number . The " sort " routine would give the user the option of Ascending / Descending order and the filter option was applied to the the phone information where employees were displayed based on a similar phone e.g. "583" .
